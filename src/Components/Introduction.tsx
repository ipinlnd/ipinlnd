          A 26-year-old software developer with 5 years of programming
          experience. I started working as a system developer, building network
          services using c/c++ in a FreeBSD environment, but because of my
          passion for visual software, I switched to full-stack development. I
          enjoy creating visually appealing applications and have experience
          working with several different technologies on mobile and web
          applications. Iâ€™ve been looking for remote jobs in Europe to gain a
          richer international experience
