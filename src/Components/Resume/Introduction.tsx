        A 25-year-old software developer with 5 years of programming experience.
        I started working as a system developer, building network services using
        c/c++ in a FreeBSD environment, but because of my passion for visual
        software, I switched to full-stack development. I enjoy creating
        visually appealing applications and have experience working with several
        different technologies on mobile and web applications. Iâ€™ve been looking
        for remote jobs in Europe to gain a richer international experience.
